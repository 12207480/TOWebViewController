# TOModalWebViewController
#### A modal view controller for iOS that allows users to quickly view web sites without needing to open Safari/Chrome

## WTF is this thing?

TOModalWebViewController is another entry in my "re-inventing-the-wheel" collection for my commercial iOS app, [iComics](http://icomics.co/).
As you can see from the screenshot, TOModalWebViewController is your standard web view controller designed with the intention of being able to quickly show
the user a web page without needing to suspend the app and moving to Safari (or Chrome).

## So. Why was it necessary to write a new one from scratch?

While I've already written a couple of Web View Controllers from scratch for other projects before (Most notably, in [iPok√©dex](http://www.ubergames.net/projects/ipokedex) ),
they've always been really quick, slapdash implementations that I put together in 5 minutes. With iComics, and the myriad number of web enabled features I'm gearing up
to add to it, I decided writing a really nice, elegant, flexible one that can handle all of my requirements would be the be the best way to go.

## Features

  * Back refresh buttons, with a forward button that only appears when necessary.
  * PROPER, ACTUAL orientation animations when rotating the device (Check out iOS Chrome, then check out Safari. You'll see what I mean.)
  * A loading bar to indicate current page load progress (using [ninjinkun's amazing algorithm](https://github.com/ninjinkun/NJKWebViewProgress) )
  * (TODO) An optional text field for which users may manually enter in a URL
  * (TODO) An optional action button to allow the user to open the page in Safari (or Chrome) as well as share the URL socially.
  * (TODO) A proper delegate system to allow external classes to interact with this controller.
  * (TODO) A rudimentary bookmark system.
