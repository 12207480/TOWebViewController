# TOWebViewController
#### A view controller for iOS that allows users to quickly view web sites without needing to open Safari/Chrome

## WTF is this thing?

TOWebViewController is another entry in my "re-inventing-the-wheel" collection for my commercial iOS app, [iComics](http://icomics.co/).
As you can see from the screenshot, TOWebViewController is your standard web view controller designed with the intention of being able to quickly show
the user web content without needing to switch to another app.

## So. Why was it necessary to write a new one from scratch?

While I've already written a couple of web view controllers from scratch for other projects before (Most notably, in [iPok√©dex](http://www.ubergames.net/projects/ipokedex) ),
they've always been really quick, slapdash implementations that I put together in 5 minutes, that barely fit the job, but were often not really reusable in other projects. 
With iComics, and the myriad number of web enabled features I'm gearing up to add to it, I decided writing a really nice, elegant, flexible one that can handle all of 
my requirements, not to mention would be properly reusable in other projects would be the be the best way to go.

## Features

  * Back refresh buttons, with a forward button that only appears when necessary.
  * PROPER, ACTUAL orientation animations when rotating the device (Check out iOS Chrome, then check out Safari. You'll see what I mean.)
  * A loading bar to indicate current page load progress (using [ninjinkun's amazing algorithm](https://github.com/ninjinkun/NJKWebViewProgress) )
  * An optional action button to allow the user to open the page in Safari (or Chrome) as well as share the URL socially.
  * (TODO) Automatically detect whether being pushed modally, or to a UINavigationController and adjust UI accordingly.
  * (TODO) Implement a confirmation dialog when the web view tries to switch to another app.
  * (TODO) Re-implement the popup that appears when users tap and hold a link for added flexibility.  
  * (TODO) An optional text field for which users may manually enter in a URL
  * (TODO) A proper delegate system to allow external classes to interact with this controller.
  * (TODO) A rudimentary bookmark system.

to shower [ninjinkun](https://github.com/ninjinkun) with much love for making tracking the page load state possible.
